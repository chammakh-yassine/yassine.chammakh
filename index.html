                    <p>
                        I believe that true success is not achieved without encountering failure. My journey exemplifies this belief, as I faced a significant setback in 2019, losing everything. This challenging period, however, became a catalyst for growth, teaching me resilience and strength. In 2020, I began to rebuild my life, learning to be optimistic, take life in stride, and focus on self-improvement.
                        <br><br>Recognizing my strengths in mathematics, physics, and problem-solving, I decided to pursue a career in IT. I enrolled in a university program in mathematics and computer science, which marked my first foray into the world of programming. I found joy in learning the C language and grasping the fundamentals of programming.
                        <br><br>Realizing that the university curriculum alone was not enough, I turned to self-learning through YouTube. This decision was a game-changer, allowing me to learn Python and appreciate its simplicity. I also completed various online courses in English and German, focusing on IT, and learned Java, which, despite its differences, was enjoyable to explore. (Of course I've learned the basics, there's still more to learn)

            <h6 class="section-title mb-6">Abilities</h6>
            <p>
              My curiosity led me to explore multiple IT disciplines, including Linux, web design, compilation, network, AI fundamentals, and smart programming. This broad exploration helped me discover a passion for solving problems and creating user-friendly experiences through programming and math. Whether developing software, programs, or games, I found immense satisfaction in these pursuits. 
            <br><br>While I may not be a natural designer, I believe in the importance of adaptability and continuous learning. This mindset drove me to learn Photoshop, video and sound editing, and even delve into 3D design, anticipating future needs for creating digital environments. I am committed to expanding my skill set, knowing that the journey of learning in IT is continuous and ever-evolving.

                        <p>One of my notable projects involved a 3D model of a small building, where I created a cinematic animation with a camera navigating through the interior. This experience sparked my interest in further exploring areas such as visual effects (VFX) and character design. I am eager to continue learning and expanding my skills in 3D modeling and animation.</p>

                        <p>I began learning Python through YouTube tutorials and continue to expand my knowledge in this versatile programming language. One of my early projects was developing a simple snake game using the curses library, which is designed for creating terminal-based applications. Although there are more visually appealing ways to create games, my goal was to learn by doing, and this project helped me grasp key programming principles.
                             <br><br>
                            Key accomplishments and skills acquired include:
                           <br>
                            - Game Development: Created a basic snake game using the curses library. (as the picture shows) <br>
                            - Principles and Planning: Applied fundamental programming concepts and structured project planning.<br>
                            - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Building on my Java background, I am now learning OOP in Python to enhance my programming skills.<br>
                            - Logging: Implemented logging to monitor and debug applications effectively.

                        <p>My university journey was quite complex and transformative. Initially,The entire study was in French, I pursued studies in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering Science. This program was rich in physics and mathematics, subjects I excelled in and deeply enjoyed. However, after a challenging year, I faced a period of depression and difficult memories. I am grateful to have overcome these obstacles and started anew with a major in Mathematics and Computer Science.<br>
                           <br>
                           This new program was also heavily focused on mathematics, but it introduced me to various IT fields, and<b> I discovered a passion for programming. I particularly enjoyed coding in C, which became my favorite subject.</b> Additionally, I gained some knowledge in:<br>
                            - JavaScript and Web Design: Understanding the basics of web development.<br>
                            - Linux and Networks: Learning about operating systems and network configurations.<br>
                            - Compiler Construction: Exploring the fundamentals of compilers.<br>
                            - SQL: Developing basic skills in database management and querying.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>However, my learning in these areas was limited, and I did not delve deeply enough to start real programs.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p> It was through programming that I realized where I truly thrived. As a result, I have a broad background in several IT fields, which makes it easier for me to dive into specialized areas such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, or database management. My journey has equipped me with the versatility and foundation needed to pursue any specific field with confidence and dedication.</p>
